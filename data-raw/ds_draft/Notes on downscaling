# Linear delta downscaling

We need to cap values to min and max


# Notes on CHELSA

Download tas and prec, using the wget interface
Each month is one file, with multiple years (probably). Create the mean of years, and then combine into a single file


CHELSA also has cloud cover, so if we wanted cloud cover for BIOME4, it would make sense to get tcc as well from here, and use CHELSA for our downscaling.

Native resolution is 30 secs, it would be worth pre-aggregating values at the same resolutions as worldclim

ETOPO2022 there is a single netcdf file for 30 secs, and one for 1 degree. We could provide the option of downloading it like other dataset, to avoid having to download on the fly every time we want to downscale.



# Uncut datasets for downscaling

For downscaling, it makes sense to start with the full data. We could create "uncut" version of the datasets with just the monthly variables of tavg and prec, to be used for downscaling

# Get vars only for annual

By default, only provide variables which are annual, and give the monthly only on request.

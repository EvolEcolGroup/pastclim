## Downscaling a dataset in pastclim `pastclim`

The `terra` package can downscale reconstructiosn using a bilinear method. Other `R`
packages also offer various approaches to downscale rasters.

For paleoclimate reconstructions, the delta method has been shown to be very effective
(Beyer et al, REF), but sea level changes require some care on how to apply such a method.
`pastclim` includes functions to use the delta method. We will focus on South East
Asia, as this area was greatly affected by sea level changes over the last glaciation.
We will work on the variable "bio01"

First, we extract a time series for the variable and region of interest:
```{r}
library(terra)
library(pastclim)
sea_ext<- terra::ext(100, 130, -15, 20)
model_series <- region_series(bio_variables = "bio01",dataset="Example",
                            ext = sea_ext)
model_series
```

Note that a `SpatRasterDataset` has been returned, which contains only one `spatRaster`
for "bio01". We want to work on that `spatRaster`, so we extract it with:

```{r}
model_rast <- model_series$bio01
model_rast
```
And we can now plot it:
```{r}
plot(model_rast)
```

We can see how that the reconstructions are rather coarse (the Example dataset
uses 1x1 degree cells). We now need a set of
high resolutions observations for the variable of interest that we will use to 
generate the delta raster used to downscale reconstructions. We will use data from
worldclim2 at 5 minute resolution (but other datasets such as CHELSA would be
equally suitable).
```{r}
high_res_file <- system.file("extdata/wc2.1_5m_bio_1_sea.tif",package="pastclim")
high_res_obs<-terra::rast(high_res_file)
plot(high_res_obs)
```

We need to make sure that the extent of the modern observations is the same as the
extent of the model reconstructions
```{r}
ext(high_res_obs)==ext(model_rast)
```

If that was not the case, we would use `terra::crop` to math the extents.
We also need a high resolution topographic/bathymetric map to reconstruct past
coastlines following sea level change:
```{r}
topo_file <- system.file("extdata/ETOPO1_Ice_c_gmt4_5min_sea.tif",package="pastclim")
topo_rast <- terra::rast(topo_file)
```

This raster also needs to have the same extent as the model reconstructions:
```{r}
ext(topo_rast)==ext(model_rast)
```

We can now generate a high resolution land mask for the periods of interest. By
default, we use the sea level reconstructions from Spratt et al 2016, but a different
reference can be used by setting sea levels for each time step (see the man page
for `make_land_mask` for details):
```{r}
high_res_mask <- make_land_mask(topo_rast = topo_rast, 
                                time_bp = time(model_rast))
plot(high_res_mask)
```

We can now compute a delta raster and use it to downscale the model reconstructions:
```{r}
delta_rast<-delta_compute(x=model_rast, ref_time = 0, obs = high_res_obs)
model_downscaled <- delta_downscale (x = model_rast, delta_rast = delta_rast,
                                 x_landmask_high = high_res_mask)
model_downscaled
```

Let's inspect the resulting data:
```{r}
plot(model_downscaled)
```

And, as a reminder, the original reconstructions:
```{r}
plot(model_rast)
```

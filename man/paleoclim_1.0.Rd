\description{
\emph{Paleoclim} is a set of high resolution paleoclimate reconstructions, mostly
based on the CESM model, downscaled with the CHELSA dataset to 3  different
spatial resolutions: \code{paleoclim_1.0_2.5m} at 2.5 arc-minutes (~5 km),
\code{paleoclim_1.0_5m} at 5 arc-minutes (~10 km), and \code{paleoclim_1.0_10m} 10
arc-minutes (~20 km). All 19 biovariables are available. There are only a
limited number of time slices available for this dataset; furthermore,
currently only time slices from present to 130ka are available in \code{pastclim}.

\item{var}{character Valid variables names are "tmin", "tmax", "tavg",
"prec", "wind", "vapr", and "bio".}

\item{res}{numeric Valid resolutions are 10, 5, 2.5,
and 0.5 (minutes of a degree)}

\item{path}{character. Path where the dataset is stored. If left NULL, the data

\description{
This function loads previously downloaded annual and monthly variables
from the Worldclim 2.1 dataset. To save the variables in a compatible
format, use \code{download_worldclim}
}
\details{
The function assumes that the file name is in the format wc\emph{version}\emph{\emph{res}m}\emph{var}.nc.
For example, average temperature downloaded at 10 minutes resolution will be
\emph{wc21_10m_tavg.nc}.

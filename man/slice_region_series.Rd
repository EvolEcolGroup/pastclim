\title{Extract a slice for a time series of climate variables for a region}
\usage{
slice_region_series(x, time_bp)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{climate time series generated with \code{region_series}}

\item{time_bp}{time slices in years before present (i.e. 1950, negative integers
for values in the past). The slices
need to exist in the dataset. To check which slices are available, you
can use \code{time_bp(x[[1]])} (note that you have to use
the `time` function on the first element of the 'sds' object, i.e. on one
of the 'SpatRaster' objects)}
}
\value{
a \code{SpatRaster} of the relevant slice.
}
\description{
This function extracts a time slice from time series of one or more climate
variables for a given dataset covering a region (or the whole world).

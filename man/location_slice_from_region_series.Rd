\title{Extract local climate for one or more locations for a given time slice.}
\usage{
location_slice_from_region_series(
  x,
  time_bp = NULL,
  time_ce = NULL,
  coords = NULL,
  region_series,
  nn_interpol = TRUE,
  buffer = FALSE,
  directions = 8
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a data.frame with columns x and y coordinates(see \code{coords} for
standard coordinate names, or how to use custom ones), plus optional
columns \code{time_bp} or \code{time_ce} (depending on the units used) and \code{name}.
Alternatively, a vector of cell numbers.}

\item{time_bp}{used if no \code{time_bp} column is present in \code{x}: the dates in
years before present (negative values represent time before present, i.e.
1950, positive values time in the future) for each location.}

\item{time_ce}{time in years CE as an alternative to \code{time_bp}. Only one of
\code{time_bp} or \code{time_ce} should be used.}

\item{coords}{a vector of length two giving the names of the "x" and "y"
coordinates, as found in \code{data}. If left to NULL, the function will try to
guess the columns based on standard names \code{c("x", "y")}, \code{c("X","Y")},
\code{c("longitude", "latitude")}, or \code{c("lon", "lat")}}

\item{region_series}{a \code{\link[terra:SpatRaster-class]{terra::SpatRasterDataset}} obtained with
\code{\link[=region_series]{region_series()}}}

\item{nn_interpol}{boolean determining whether nearest neighbour
interpolation is used to estimate climate for cells that lack such
information (i.e. they are under water or ice). By default, interpolation
is only performed from the first ring of nearest neighbours; if climate is
not available, NA will be returned for that location. The number of
neighbours can be changed with the argument \code{directions}. \code{nn_interpol}
defaults to TRUE.}

\item{buffer}{boolean determining whether the variable will be returned as
the mean of a buffer around the focal cell. If set to TRUE, it overrides
\code{nn_interpol} (which provides the same estimates as \code{buffer} but only for
locations that are in cells with an NA). The buffer size is determined by
the argument \code{directions}. \code{buffer} defaults to FALSE.}

\item{directions}{character or matrix to indicate the directions in which
cells are considered connected when using \code{nn_interpol} or \code{buffer}. The
following character values are allowed: "rook" or "4" for the horizontal
and vertical neighbours; "bishop" to get the diagonal neighbours; "queen"
or "8" to get the vertical, horizontal and diagonal neighbours; or "16" for
knight and one-cell queen move neighbours. If directions is a matrix it
should have odd dimensions and have logical (or 0, 1) values.}
}
\value{
a data.frame with the climatic variables of interest.
}
\description{
This function extract local climate for a set of locations at the appropriate
times (selecting the closest time slice available for the specific date
associated with each location).

\title{Documentation for the WorldClim datasets}
\description{
WorldClim version 2.1 is a database of high spatial resolution global weather and
climate data, covering both the present and future projections.
}
\details{
The present reconstructions are based on the mean for the period 1970-2000,
and are available at multiple resolutions of
10 arc-minutes, 5 arc-minutes, 2.5 arc-minute and 0.5 arc-minutes. The resolution
of interest can be obtained by changing the ending of the dataset name
"WorldClim_2.1_RESm", e.g. WorldClim_2.1_10m or WorldClim_2.1_5m
(currently, only 10m and 5m are available on \code{pastclim}). In \code{pastclim}, the datasets are given
a date of 1985 CE (the mid-point of the period of interest), corresponding to
a time_bp of 35. There are monthly climate data for minimum, mean, and maximum temperature, precipitation,
and 19 “bioclimatic” variables.

Future projections are based on the models in CMIP6, downscaled and debiased
using Worldclim 2.1 for the present as a baseline. Monthly values of minimum
temperature, maximum temperature, and precipitation, as well as 19 bioclimatic
variables were processed for
23 global climate models (GCMs), and for four
Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs): 126, 245, 370 and 585. Model and
SSP can be chosen by changing the neding of the dataset name
"WorldClim_2.1_GCM_SSP_RESm".
Reconstructions are averages over 20 year periods (2021-2040, 241-2060, 2061-2080, 2081-2100).
In \code{pastclim}, the midpoints of the periods are used as the time stamps.

\description{
CHELSA-TraCE21k data provides monthly climate data for temperature and
precipitation at 30 arc-sec spatial resolution in 100-year time steps for the
last 21,000 years. Palaeo-orography at high spatial resolution and at each
time step is created by combining high resolution information on glacial
cover from current and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) glacier databases with
the interpolation of a dynamic ice sheet model (ICE6G) and a coupling to
mean annual temperatures from CCSM3-TraCE21k. Based on the reconstructed
palaeo-orography, mean annual temperature and precipitation was downscaled
using the CHELSA V1.2 algorithm.

More details on the dataset are available on its dedicated
\href{https://chelsa-climate.org/chelsa-trace21k/}{website}.

An alternative to
downloading very large files is to use virtual rasters. Simply append
"_vis" to the name of the dataset of interest (\emph{CHELSA_trace21k_1.0_0.5m_vsi}).
This is the recommended approach, and it is currently the only available version of the dataset.

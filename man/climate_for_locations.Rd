\title{Extract local climate for one or more locations.}
\usage{
climate_for_locations(
  x,
  time_bp,
  bio_variables,
  dataset,
  path_to_nc = NULL,
  nn_interpol = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a 2 column matrix (with columns `longitude`, ranging
-180 to 180, and `latitude`, from -90 to 90), or a vector of cell numbers.}

\item{time_bp}{vector of ages, in years before present (negative).}

\item{bio_variables}{vector of names of variables to be extracted.}

\item{dataset}{string defining the dataset to use (one of Beyer2020, Krapp2021 or custom).}

\item{path_to_nc}{the path to the directory containing the downloaded resonstructions.
Leave it unset if you are using the companion `pastclimData` to store datasets.}

\item{nn_interpol}{boolean determining whether nearest neighbour interpolation is
used to estimate climate for cells that lack such information (i.e. they are
under water or ice). Interpolation is only performed from the first ring of
nearest neighbours; if climate is not available, NA will be returned for
that location. Defaults to TRUE.}

\title{Documentation for the Krapp2021 dataset}
\description{
This dataset covers the last 800k years, at intervals of 1k years, and a
resolution of 0.5 degrees in latitude and longitude.
}
\details{
The units of several variables have been changed to match what is used
in WorldClim.

If you use this dataset, make sure to cite the original publication:

reconstruction of high-resolution global terrestrial climate for the last

The version included in \code{pastclim} has the ice sheets masked.

Note that, for bio15, we use the corrected version, which follows

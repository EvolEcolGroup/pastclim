# Install the library

You will need to install the library from GitHub. For this step, you will need to
use `devtools` (if you haven't done so already, install it from CRAN with `install.packages("devtools")`.
Once you have `devtools`, simply use:
```{r install, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("EvolEcolGroup/pastclim")
```

There is a vignette with detailed step by step examples on how to use the library. You can
find it on the website for the package. Or, if needed, you can build it when installing
`pastclim` :
```{r install_vignette, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("EvolEcolGroup/pastclim", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

And read it directly in R with:
```{r vignette, eval=FALSE}
vignette("pastclim_overview", package = "pastclim")
```
Depending on the operating system you use, you might need additional packages to build
a vignette.

---

NOTE: `pastclim` relies on `terra` to process rasters. There is a known bug in
`terra` that leads to the occasional message: 
```
"Error in x$.self$finalize() : attempt to apply non-function"
```

being reported. This is an error related to garbage collection, which does not 
affect the script being correctly executed, so it can be ignored. More discussion
of this issue can be found on [stack**overflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61598340/why-does-rastertopoints-generate-an-error-on-first-call-but-not-second)


# Download the data
You will need to download climatic reconstructions before being able to do any
work with `pastclim`. Currently the library contains two datasets: 
*Beyer2020* which covers the last 120k years; and, for project that go further back in time, *Krapp2021* which goes back to 800kya. It is possible to add additional, custom datasets, but
you will need some familiarity with handling `netcdf` files (see the vignette on 
'custom dataset').

```{r eval=FALSE}
vignette("custom_datasets", package = "pastclim")
```

A list of all datasets available can be obtained by typing 

```{r eval=FALSE}
vignette("available_datasets", package = "pastclim")
```

Please be aware that using any dataset made available to pastclim will require to cite both pastclim and the original publication presenting the dataset. The reference to cite for pastclim can be obtained by typing

```{r}
citation("pastclim")
```

while the reference associated to any dataset of choice (in this case "Beyer2020") is displayed together with the general information on it through the command:

```{r eval=FALSE}
help("Beyer2020")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
pastclim:::get_dataset_info(dataset="Beyer2020")
```

For the datasets available in `pastclim`, there are functions that help you download the data
and choose the variables. When you start `pastclim` for the first time, you will
need to set the path where reconstructions are stored using `set_data_path`. By
default, the package data path will be used:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(pastclim)
set_data_path()
```

```{r echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(pastclim)
set_data_path_for_CRAN()
```

```
#> The data_path will be set to /home/andrea/.local/share/R/pastclim.
#> A copy of the Example dataset will be copied there.
#> This path will be saved by pastclim for future use.
#> Proceed? 
#> 
#> 1: Yes
#> 2: No
```

Press 1 if you are happy with the offered choices, and `pastclim`
will remember your data path in future sessions. Note that your
data path will look different than in this example, as it depends
on your user name and operating system.

If you prefer using a custom path (e.g. in "~/my_reconstructions"), it can be set with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
set_data_path(path_to_nc = "~/my_reconstructions")
```

The package includes a small dataset, *Example*, that we will use in this vignette but is not suitable for running analyses;
the real datasets are large (from 100s of Mb to a few Gb), and you will need to specify
what you want to download (see below).

Let us start by inspecting the *Example* dataset. We can get a list of variables
available for this dataset with:

```{r}
get_vars_for_dataset(dataset = "Example")
```

and the available time steps can be obtained with:

```{r}
get_time_steps(dataset = "Example")
```

For *Beyer2020* and *Krapp2021*, you can get a list
of available variables for each dataset with:
```{r}
get_vars_for_dataset(dataset = "Beyer2020")
```

and 

```{r}
get_vars_for_dataset(dataset = "Krapp2021")
```

For monthly variables, months are coded as "_xx" at the end of the variable names; e.g. "temperature_02" is the
mean monthly temperature for February. A more thorough description of each variable (including the units) can be obtained with:
```{r}
get_vars_for_dataset(dataset="Example", details = TRUE)
```

You will not be able to get the available time steps until you download the data. `pastclim` offers an interface
to download the necessary files into your data path. 

To inspect which datasets and variables have already been downloaded in the data path,
we can use:
```{r}
get_downloaded_datasets()
```

Let's now download *bio01* and *bio05* for the *Beyer2020* dataset (this operation might take several minutes, as the datasets are large; `R` will pause until
the download is complete):

```{r eval=FALSE}
download_dataset(dataset = "Beyer2020", bio_variables = c("bio01", "bio05"))
```

Note that multiple variables can be packed together into a single file, so
`get_downloaded_datasets()` might list more variables than the ones that we chose to download (it depends on the dataset).

When upgrading `pastclim`, new version of various datasets might become available.
This will make the previously downloaded datasets obsolete, and you might suddenly
be told by `pastclim` that some variables have to be re-downloaded. This can lead
to the accumulation of old datasets in your data path. The function `clean_data_path()`
can be used to delete old files that are no longer needed.

# Get climate for locations

Often we want to get the climate for specific locations. We can do so by using
the function `location_slice`. With this function, we will get slices of climate
for the times relevant to the locations of interest.

Let us consider five possible locations of interest: Iho Eleru (a Late Stone Age inland site 
in Nigeria), La Riera (a Late Palaeolithic coastal site on Spain), Chalki (a Mesolithic site on a 
Greek island), Oronsay (a Mesolithic site in the Scottish Hebrides), and Atlantis (the fabled submersed city
mentioned by Plato). For each site we have a date (realistic, but made up) that we are interested in associating
with climatic reconstructions.

```{r}
locations <- data.frame(
  name = c("Iho Eleru","La Riera", "Chalki", "Oronsay","Atlantis"), 
  longitude = c(5,-4, 27, -6, -24), latitude = c(7, 44, 36, 56, 31),
  time_bp = c(-11200, -18738,-10227, -10200, -11600)
)
locations
```

And extract their climatic conditions for *bio01* and *bio12*:
```{r}
location_slice(
  x = locations, bio_variables = c("bio01", "bio12"),
  dataset = "Example", nn_interpol = FALSE
)
```
`pastclim` finds the closest time steps (slices) available for a given date, and outputs
the slice used in column `time_bp_slice` (the *Example* dataset that we use in this vignette has a temporal resolution of only 5k years).

Note that the last Chalki and Atlantis, for the appropriate time steps, are not available. This occurs when a location, in the reconstructions, was either under water or ice, and so `pastclim` can not return any estimate. In some instances, this is due to the discretisation of space in the raster. We can interpolate climate among the nearest neighbours, thus using climate reconstructions for neighbouring pixels if the location is just off one or more land pixels:
```{r}
location_slice(
  x = locations, bio_variables = c("bio01", "bio12"),
  dataset = "Example", nn_interpol = TRUE)
```
For Chalki, we can see that the problem is indeed that, since it is a small island, it is not
well represented in the reconstructions (bear in mind that the `Example` dataset is
very coarse in resolution), and so we can reconstruct some appropriate climate by interpolating. Atlantis, on the other hand, is the middle of the ocean, and so there is no information
on what the climate might have been before became submerged (assuming it ever existed...). Note that `nn_interpol = TRUE` is the default for this function.

Sometimes, we want to get a time series of climatic reconstructions, thus allowing us to
see how climate changed over time:
```{r}
locations_ts <- location_series(
  x = locations,
  bio_variables = c("bio01", "bio12"),
  dataset = "Example")
```

The resulting dataframe can be subsetted to get the time series for each location
(the small *Example* dataset only contains 5 time slices):
```{r}
subset(locations_ts, name == "Iho Eleru")
```
Also note that for some locations, climate can be available only for certain time steps, depending on sea level and ice sheet extent. This is the case for Oronsay: 
```{r}
subset(locations_ts, name == "Oronsay")
```

We can quickly plot `bio1` through time for the locations:
```{r, warning=TRUE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=locations_ts, aes(x=time_bp, y=bio01, group=name)) +
  geom_line(aes(col=name))+
  geom_point(aes(col=name))
```

As expected, we don't have data for Atlantis (as it is always underwater), but we
also fail to retrieve data for Chalki. This is because `location_series` does not
interpolate from nearest neighbours by default (so, it differs from `location_slice`
in behaviour). The rationale for this behaviour is that we are intersted in whether
some locations might end underwater, and so we do not want to grab climate estimates
if they have been submerged. However, in some cases (as for Chalki) it might be
necessary to allow for interpolation.

Pretty labels for environmental variables can be generated with `var_labels`:
```{r, warning=TRUE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=locations_ts, aes(x=time_bp, y=bio01, group=name)) +
  geom_line(aes(col=name))+
  geom_point(aes(col=name))+
  labs(y = var_labels("bio01", dataset="Example", abbreviated=TRUE),
       x = "time BP (yr)")
```

*Note* that these climatic reconstructions were extracted from the `Example` dataset,
which is very coarse, so they should not be used to base any real inference about
their environmental conditions. But note that higher resolution is not always better.
It is important to consider the appropriate spatial
scale that is relevant to the question at hand. Sometimes, it might be necessary
to downscale the simulations (see section at the end of this vignette), or in other
cases we might want to get estimates to cover an area around the specific location
(e.g. if we are comparing to proxies that capture the climatology of a broad area,
such as certain sediment cores that capture pollen from the broader region).
`location_slice` and `location_series` can provide
mean estimates for areas around the location coordinates by setting the `buffer`
parameter (see the help pages of those functions for details).

# Get climate for a region

Instead of focussing on specific locations, we might want to look at a whole region.
For a given time step, we can extract a slice of climate with

```{r}
climate_20k <- region_slice(
  time_bp = -20000,
  bio_variables = c("bio01", "bio10", "bio12"),
  dataset = "Example"
)
```

This returns a raster (technically a `SpatRaster` object as defined in the `terra`
library, meaning that we can perform all standard `terra` raster operations
on this object). To interact with `SpatRaster` objects, it is best to load the
`terra` library (otherwise you might get errors as the correct method is not found, e.g. 
when plotting); we can then get a summary of this object:
```{r}
library(terra)
climate_20k
```

and plot these three variables (the layers of the raster):
```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
terra::plot(climate_20k, main = names(climate_20k))
```

We can add more informative labels with `var_labels`:
```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
terra::plot(climate_20k, main = var_labels(climate_20k, dataset = "Example"))
```  

It is possible to also load a time series of rasters with the function `region_series`. In this case, the function returns a `SpatRasterDataset`, with each variable as a sub-dataset:

```{r}
climate_region <- region_series(
  time_bp = list(min = -15000, max = 0), 
  bio_variables = c("bio01", "bio10", "bio12"),
  dataset = "Example")
climate_region
```

Each of these sub-dataset is a `SpatRaster`, with time steps as layers:

```{r}
climate_region$bio01
```

Note that `terra` stores dates in years a AD, not BP.

We can then plot the time series of a given variable (we relabel the plots
to use years bp):
```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
terra::plot(climate_region$bio01, main=time_bp(climate_region$bio01))
```

To plot all climate variables for a given time step, we can slice the time series:
```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
slice_10k <- slice_region_series(climate_region, time_bp = -10000)
terra::plot(slice_10k, main = names(slice_10k))
```

Instead of giving a minimum and maximum time step, you can also provide
specific time steps to `region_series`. Note that `pastclim` has a function to get a vector
of the time steps for a given MIS in a dataset. For example, for MIS 1, we get:
```{r}
mis1_steps <- get_mis_time_steps(mis = 1, dataset = "Example")
mis1_steps
```

Which we can then use:
```{r}
climate_mis1 <- region_series(
  time_bp = mis1_steps, 
  bio_variables = c("bio01", "bio10", "bio12"),
  dataset = "Example"
)
climate_mis1
```

# Cropping

Often we want to focus a given region. There are a number of preset rectangular extents in 
`pastclim`:
```{r}
names(region_extent)
```

We can get the corners of the European extent:
```{r}
region_extent$Europe
```

And then we can extract climate only for Europe by setting `ext` in `region_slice`:

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
europe_climate_20k <- region_slice(
  time_bp = -20000,
  bio_variables = c("bio01", "bio10", "bio12"),
  dataset = "Example",
  ext = region_extent$Europe
)
terra::plot(europe_climate_20k,
            main = names(europe_climate_20k))
```

As we can see in the plot, cutting Europe using a rectangular shape keeps a portion of Northern Africa in the map. `pastclim` includes a number of pre-generated masks for the main continental masses, stored in the dataset `region_outline` in an `sf::sfc` object. We can get a list with:

```{r}
names(region_outline)
```
We can then use the function `crop` within `region_slice` to only keep the area within the desired outline.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
europe_climate_20k <- region_slice(
  time_bp = -20000,
  c("bio01", "bio10", "bio12"),
  dataset = "Example",
  crop = region_outline$Europe
)
terra::plot(europe_climate_20k,
            main = names(europe_climate_20k))
```

We can combine multiple regions together. For example, we can crop to Africa and Eurasia by unioning the two individual outlines:

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
library(sf)
afr_eurasia <- sf::st_union(region_outline$Africa, region_outline$Eurasia)
climate_20k_afr_eurasia <- region_slice(
  time_bp = -20000,
  bio_variables  = c("bio01", "bio10", "bio12"),
  dataset = "Example",
  crop = afr_eurasia)
terra::plot(climate_20k_afr_eurasia,
            main = names(climate_20k_afr_eurasia))
```

Note that outlines that cross the antimeridian are split into multiple polygons (so that they can be used without projecting the rasters). For Eurasia, we have the eastern end of Siberia on the left hand side of the plot. `continent_outlines_union` provides the same outlines as single polygons (in case you want to use a projection). 

You can also use your own custom outline (i.e. a polygon, coded as a `terra::vect` 
object) as a mask to limit 
the area covered by the raster. Note that you need to 
reuse the first vertex as the last vertex, to close the polygon:

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
custom_vec <- terra::vect("POLYGON ((0 70, 25 70, 50 80, 170 80, 170 10,
                              119 2.4, 119 0.8, 116 -7.6, 114 -12, 100 -40,
                              -25 -40, -25 64, 0 70))")
climate_20k_custom <- region_slice(
  time_bp = -20000,
  bio_variables = c("bio01", "bio10", "bio12"),
  dataset = "Example",
  crop = custom_vec)
terra::plot(climate_20k_custom, 
            main = names(climate_20k_custom))
```

`region_series` takes the same `ext` and `crop` options as `region_slice` to limit
the extent of the climatic reconstructions.

# Working with biomes and ice sheets

The Beyer2020 and Krapp2021 datasets include a categorical variable detailing the extension of biomes.

```{r}
get_biome_classes("Example")
```

If we need to plot the extent of a specific biome, for example the desert, we first extract the variable and then subset it to just the class we are interested in using its ID (21, in this case):

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
climate_20k <- region_slice(
  time_bp = -20000,
  bio_variables = c("bio01", "bio10", "biome"),
  dataset = "Example"
)
climate_20k$desert <- climate_20k$biome
climate_20k$desert[climate_20k$desert != 21] <- FALSE
climate_20k$desert[climate_20k$desert == 21] <- TRUE
terra::plot(climate_20k, main = names(climate_20k))
```

The climate reconstructions do not show areas under permanent ice. Ice sheets are stored as class 28 in the "biome" variable:

To plot it, we use functions designed to get ice and land masks.
```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
climate_20k <- region_slice(
  time_bp = -20000,
  bio_variables = c("bio01", "bio10"),
  dataset = "Example"
)
climate_20k$ice_mask <- get_ice_mask(-20000, dataset = "Example")
climate_20k$land_mask <- get_land_mask(-20000, dataset = "Example")
terra::plot(climate_20k, main = names(climate_20k))
```

# Set the samples within the background

In many studies, we want to set the environmental conditions at a given set of
location within the background for that time period. Let us start by
visualising the background for the time step of interest with a PCA:

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
bio_vars <- c("bio01", "bio10", "bio12")
climate_10k <- region_slice(-10000,
  bio_variables = bio_vars,
  dataset = "Example"
)
climate_values_10k <- df_from_region_slice(climate_10k)
climate_10k_pca <- prcomp(climate_values_10k[, bio_vars], 
                          scale = TRUE, center = TRUE)
plot(climate_10k_pca$x[, 2] ~ climate_10k_pca$x[, 1],
  pch = 20, col = "lightgray",
  xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2"
)
```

We can now get the climatic conditions for the locations at this time step and compute the PCA scores based on the axes we defined on the background:
```{r}
locations_10k <- data.frame(
  longitude = c(0, 90, 20, 5), latitude = c(20, 45, 50, 47),
  time_bp = c(-9932, -9753, -10084, -10249)
)
climate_loc_10k <- location_slice(
  x = locations_10k[, c("longitude", "latitude")],
  time_bp = locations_10k$time_bp, bio_variables = bio_vars,
  dataset = "Example"
)
locations_10k_pca_scores <- predict(climate_10k_pca, 
                                    newdata = climate_loc_10k[, bio_vars])
```

And now we can plot the points on top of the background
```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
plot(climate_10k_pca$x[, 2] ~ climate_10k_pca$x[, 1],
  pch = 20, col = "lightgray",
  xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2"
)
points(locations_10k_pca_scores, pch = 20, col = "red")
```

If we want to pool the background from multiple time steps, we can simple use
`region_series` to get a series, and then transform it into a data frame with
`df_from_region_series`.

# Random sampling of background

NOTE: there is a bug in terra 1.6.17 that prevents this section from 
working; you will get a "negative probability" error when sampling 
if you use that version.

For a number of species distribution models, rather than using the complete
background, we need to subsample background points to our presences. 
If we are interested in a single time step, we can simply generate the 
raster for the time slice of interest, and use `sample_region_slice`:

```{r}
climate_20k <- region_slice(
  time_bp = -20000,
  bio_variables = c("bio01", "bio10"),
  dataset = "Example"
)
this_sample <- sample_region_slice(climate_20k, size = 100)
head(this_sample)
```

We can also sample the background for multiple time steps (e.g. if we want to 
match the background to the number of samples based on their radiocarbon dates).
So, for example, if
we wanted 3 samples from 20k years ago and 5 samples from 10k years ago:

```{r}
climate_ts <- region_series(
  time_bp = c(-20000,-10000),
  bio_variables = c("bio01", "bio10", "bio12"),
  dataset = "Example",
  ext = terra::ext(region_extent$Europe)
)
sampled_climate <- sample_region_series(climate_ts, size = c(3,5))
sampled_climate
```

# Downscaling

`pastclim` does not contain built-in code to change the spatial resolution of the climatic reconstructions, but it is possible to downscale the data by using the relevant function from the `terra` package. 

At first we will need to extract a region and time of choice, in this case Northern America 10,000 years ago

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
Namerica_10k <- region_slice(dataset="Example", c("bio01"),
                               time_bp=-10000, ext=region_extent$N_America)
terra::plot(Namerica_10k)
```

We can then downscale using the `disagg()` function from the `terra` package, requiring an aggregation factor expressed as number of cells in each direction (horizontally, vertically, and, if needed, over layers). In the example below we used 25 both horizontally and vertically, using bilinear interpolation.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}  
Namerica_ds <- terra::disagg(Namerica_10k, fact=25, method='bilinear')
terra::plot(Namerica_ds)

```

#' Documentation for the Beyer2020 dataset
#'
#' This dataset covers the last 120k years, at intervals of 1/2 k years, and a 
#' resolution of 0.5 degrees in latitude and longitude.

#' The version included in `pastclim` has the icesheets masked, as well as
#' internal seas (Black and Caspian Sea) removed. The latter are based on:

#' As there is no reconstruction of their depth throught time, modern outlines
#' were used for all time steps.
#'
#' Also, for bio15, the coefficient of variation was computed after adding one
#' to monthly estimates, and it was multiplied by 100 following

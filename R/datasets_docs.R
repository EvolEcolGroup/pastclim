#' This dataset covers the last 120k years, at intervals of 1/2 k years, and a 
#' resolution of 0.5 degrees in latitude and longitude.

#' The version included in `pastclim` has the ice sheets masked, as well as

#' As there is no reconstruction of their depth through time, modern outlines
#' were used for all time steps.

#' Also, for bio15, the coefficient of variation was computed after adding one
#' to monthly estimates, and it was multiplied by 100 following

#' Documentation for the WorldClim datasets
#'
#' WorldClim version 2.1 is a database of high spatial resolution global weather and 
#' climate data, covering both the present and future projections. 
#' 
#' **Present-day reconstructions** are based on the mean for the period 1970-2000, 
#' and are available at multiple resolutions of
#' 10 arc-minutes, 5 arc-minutes, 2.5 arc-minute and 0.5 arc-minutes. The resolution
#' of interest can be obtained by changing the ending of the dataset name 
#' *WorldClim_2.1_RESm*, e.g. *WorldClim_2.1_10m* or *WorldClim_2.1_5m*
#' (currently, only 10m and 5m are currently available in `pastclim`). In `pastclim`, the datasets are given
#' a date of 1985 CE (the mid-point of the period of interest), corresponding to
#' a time_bp of 35. There are 19 “bioclimatic” variables, as well as monthly 
#' estimates for minimum, mean, and maximum temperature, and precipitation.
#' 
#' **Future projections** are based on the models in CMIP6, downscaled and de-biased
#' using WorldClim 2.1 for the present as a baseline. Monthly values of minimum
#' temperature, maximum temperature, and precipitation, as well as 19 bioclimatic
#' variables were processed for
#' 23 global climate models (GCMs), and for four 
#' Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs): 126, 245, 370 and 585. Model and
#' SSP can be chosen by changing the ending of the dataset name
#' *WorldClim_2.1_GCM_SSP_RESm*. 
#' 
#' Available values for GCM are: "ACCESS-CM2", 
#' "BCC-CSM2-MR", "CMCC-ESM2", "EC-Earth3-Veg", "FIO-ESM-2-0",
#' "GFDL-ESM4", "GISS-E2-1-G", "HadGEM3-GC31-LL", "INM-CM5-0", "IPSL-CM6A-LR",
#' "MIROC6", "MPI-ESM1-2-HR", "MRI-ESM2-0", and "UKESM1-0-LL". For SSP, use: "ssp126",
#' "ssp245",	"ssp370",	and "ssp585". RES takes the same values as for present reconstructions
#' (i.e. "10m", "5m", "2.5m", and "0.5m"). Example dataset names are 
#' *WorldClim_2.1_ACCESS-CM2_ssp245_10m* and *WorldClim_2.1_MRI-ESM2-0_ssp370_5m*
#'  
#' The dataset are averages over 20 year 
#' periods (2021-2040, 2041-2060, 2061-2080, 2081-2100).
#' In `pastclim`, the midpoints of the periods (2030, 2050, 2070, 2090) are used as the time stamps. All 4 periods
#' are automatically downloaded for each combination of GCM model and SSP, and are selected
#' as usual by defining the time in functions such as [region_slice()].

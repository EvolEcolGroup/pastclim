#' Get metadata from vrt
#'
#' This function extract metadata information from a vrt. It returns the
#' description for the whole dataset (needed to set the varname in the raster)
#' and time information for each band. It first checks that the vrt dataset has
#' a metadata element with key "pastclim_time_bp" set to TRUE. If that is the
#' case, for each band, it extract the metadata with key "time" and returns them
#' as numeric (i.e. converting them from character). Note that an error is
#' returned if there are duplicated time elements for any of the bands (whilst
#' duplicated elements are valid in the XML schema for VRT, they do not make
#' sense for the time axis).
#' @param vrt_path path to the XML file defining the vrt dataset
#' @returns list of three elements: vector `description` and `time_bp` defining
#'   each band, and a boolean `time_bp` show determining whether times should be
#'   given as time_bp when labelling bands by `terra`.

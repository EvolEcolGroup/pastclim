#' Validate an netcdf file for pastclim
#'
#' This function validates a netcdf file as a potential dataset for `pastclim`.
#' The key checks are:
#' a) that the dimensions (longitude, latitude and time) have been set correctly.
#' b) that all variables have the appropriate metadata (longname and units)
#'
#' @param path_to_nc path to the nc file of interest
#' @returns TRUE if the file is valid.
#'
#' @export

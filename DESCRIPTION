Description: Currently this package focuses on Beyer et al 2020, a reconstruction
    of climate based on the HadCM3 model for the last 120k years, and Krapp et al 
    2021, covering the last 800k years. The reconstructions
    are bias-corrected and downscaled to 0.5 degree, and this package helps using
    these data for ecological and archaeological studies.

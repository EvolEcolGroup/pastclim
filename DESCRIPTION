Title: This package provides helper functions to interact with timeseries of worldwide climate
    reconstructions
Version: 0.9.0
Author: Andrea Manica
Maintainer: Andrea Manica <am315@cam.ac.uk>
Description: Currently this package focuses on Beyer et al 2020, a reconstruction
    of climate based on the HadCM3 model for the last 120k years, and Krapp et al 
    2021, covering the last 800k years. The reconstructions
    are bias-corrected and downscaled to 0.5 degree, and this package helps using
    these data for ecological and archaeological studies.

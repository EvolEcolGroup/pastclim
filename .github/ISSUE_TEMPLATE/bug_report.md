<!--
Before filing a bug report, please check that there are no issues (open or closed) that already deal with the same bug,
and test against the development version of `pastclim` (see <https://github.com/EvolEcolGroup/pastclim> for how to install it)

Please include a minimal reproducible example (AKA a reprex). If you've never heard of a [reprex](http://reprex.tidyverse.org/) before, start by reading <https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex>. Ensure that your reprex generates the error when you paste it into a fresh
instance of `R`, with no additional variables/packages being loaded. Please also include the output of `utils::sessionInfo()`.

For more advice on how to write a great issue, see <https://code-review.tidyverse.org/issues/>.

Brief description of the problem and what output you expected.

```r
# insert reprex here (showing both the code and the error/unexpected output)
```

```r
# insert the output of `utils::sessionInfo()`
```

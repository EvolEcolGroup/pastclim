## This is a resubmission
The previous submission raised:
Check: Rd cross-references, Result: NOTE
   Found the following Rd file(s) with Rd \link{} targets missing package
   anchors:
     location_slice_from_region_series.Rd: SpatRasterDataset
     slice_region_series.Rd: SpatRaster
   Please provide package anchors for all Rd \link{} targets not in the
   package itself and the base packages.
   
Those links have now been fixed with the appropriate package anchors.
